Project: User Management System with Express.js and PostgreSQL

The project demonstrates proficiency in building a user management system using Express.js and PostgreSQL.
Notably, the project effectively implements user registration, login authentication, user details management, and user goal tracking.
However, consider improving the error handling mechanism and adding more detailed documentation for better understanding and maintenance.
I think you've done a fantastic job and I can see your progress from the start of the bootcamp!!!!
